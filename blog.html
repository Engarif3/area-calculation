            <li>1) <b>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</b>  <br> <br>
                <p class="text-blue-300">Dom stands for Document Object Model. It represents HTML and XML documents as a structure of nodes and objects. <br> <br>In other way we can say that DOM represents the logical structure of documents and how they are accessed and manipulated. DOM helps us  to create, update, and delete the document structure, style, and content. <br> <br></p> 
            </li>
            <li> 2) <b>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</b>  <br> <br>

                    iii) Select HTML elements by id. <br> <br>

            <li>3) <b>What is event bubble?</b>  <br> <br>
                <p class="text-blue-300">Event Bubbling is a term used in  DOM (Document Object Model). It occurs when an element  is received as an event, and that event goes up or bubbles up (or  can be said that how it  is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it finds  the root element. 

                </p>  <br> <br>

            </li>
            <li>4) <b>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</b>  <br> <br>
                <p class="text-blue-300">A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.It should be called when a certain condition is met. It does not get called immediately rather the callback function is called after a certain period of time.</p>
